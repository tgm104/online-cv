    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hi, hello, and welcome. My name is Matias Nevaranta and I am a full-time pleb. Pleb is latin meaning plebeian which means
      commoner. I have mostly studied IT through the years
      but now I am leaning towards business since I find it more promising in terms of career building. As an IT engineer I have a
      good knowledge of IT from radio networks to application interfaces. I also like cars and motorbikes, have had a few of each.
      I have done various jobs before ranging from IT engineer to secretary to construction worker to analytics, so work 
      experience I have. Currently I am studying for my second degree (BBA) and working two jobs, as a project worker in Learning
      Analytics and as an executive area supervisor.

      As an IT guy I have several computers; one is running dual boot W7/W10, two W7 and one Ubuntu Budgie. As I live in a remote location I also
      have three UPS power supplies (~7kVA) backed by a diesel powered aggregator in case of blackouts. I have in total seven computers
      the oldest of which is still a fully functional Compaq Armada laptop that shipped with W95. I also have been collecting mobile
      devices and I have 41 of them ranging from iPhone to an old Nokia 6600 to an even older Nokia 2010.
      
      As a motor vehicle enthusiast I have two cars; a 2014 Volvo V40 Cross Country and a 1998 Toyota Corolla (E11). I also used to
      have a motorbike; last one was a 2004 Honda CBR Super Blackbird.

experiences:
    - role: Project Worker
      time: 2019 - Present
      company: Satakunta UAS, Pori
      details: |
        My current full-time position is project worker at Satakunta University of Applied Sciences.
        The project I am working in is based on learning analytics and their application. The project
        is a national level undertaking that has members from every university of applied sciences in it.
        The goal is to create standards for the use of analytics in education through application.
        My task is testing and integration of analytics onto our learning management platforms and advising
        on the technical specifications. This work has expanded my IT skills and also given me more
        motivation towards IT.
       
          
    - role: Area Supervisor
      time: 2013 - Present
      company: Autoparkki Norden Oy, Helsinki
      details: |
        This has been my part-time position for over six years now. I work as a supervisor whenever I am
        needed or have time to spare. Initially I began working for AP to fund my studies but since then
        I have stayed because I have a very good superior here. My work here mostly consists of maintenance
        these days but I will occasionally do metermaid duties as well. I did my engineers thesis for the 
        global group this company belongs to.
        
        
    - role: Final Documentation Controller
      time: 2018 - 2018
      company: Areva GmbH, Olkiluoto
      details: |
        I worked in the construction site of TVO's nuclear power plant OL3 under Areva. My task at the plant
        was to check the documentation of electrical systems and designs together with the QI team. The
        documentation cycle was very refined and confined at the plant so I learned very good and punctual 
        organisational skills while there. Also the official language of the site was english so it was a
        good opportunity to brush up my language skills.


    - role: Project Worker
      time: 2018 - 2018
      company: Satakunta UAS, Pori
      details: |
        Before working at the power plant I got a temporary position to help the education services do a
        LMS migration project. My task was to setup the new LMS system, test and debug it, and eventually
        open it to production. I designed and created the customized theme for the LMS and the portal site
        which through the SSO worked for the signin. Once published to production I lead the in-house training
        for the new system and finally documented the project. I learned tons about projects and documentation
        here while also expanding my IT skills through work.
      
    - role: ICT Technician
      time: 2016 - 2017
      company: Satakunta UAS, Pori
      details: |
        My first job at Satakunta University of Applied Sciences. The task was simple; to build the network
        for the new campus which was built for the university. This meant the whole works; LAN, WLAN, surveillance
        systems, distribution stations, system monitoring, server room with hot and cold tunneling, electrics and
        backups, even all the projectors and speakers. It was a massive project and we began it as a four member
        team. Later I got my own team to lead and do installations with. Also because I had a background in radio
        communications I had the lead in the WLAN planning. 140 wireless routers were installed based on the data
        I received from scanning the building for optimal positioning. The routers were controlled by two central
        controllers which were connected to the monitoring room. The capacity for the WLAN was calculated to
        withstand over 5000 simultaneous users with intelligent cell distribution among the access points. 
        
    - role: Advanced IT support
      time: 2013 - 2015
      company: Relacom Finland Oy, Tampere
      details: |
        During my studies I was offered a job as a mobile IT support which I accepted gladly. Relacom is a
        telecommunications corporate giant that does mostly outsourced IT and networking related contracts. I
        was a mobile IT technician who moved all around the province and worked mainly at the different
        companies in Rauma, Pori and Tampere. I got my advanced certification later and with it I could apply
        for engineer level support tasks as well. Through Relacom I learned how to work independently on a
        daily basis since I practically never visited my office at Ylöjärvi. My daily routine consisted of me
        checking the tickets and calling the customers in the morning, being at customer companys premises
        during the day and finally closing and documenting the tickets in the evening. It was nice.
