    summary: |
      Hi, hello, and welcome. My name is Matias Nevaranta and I am a full-time plebian. I have mostly studied IT through the years
      but now I am leaning towards business since I find it more promising in terms of career building. As an IT engineer I have a
      good knowledge of IT from radio networks to application interfaces. I also like cars and motorbikes, have had a few of each.
      I have done various jobs before ranging from IT engineer to secretary to construction worker to analytics, so work 
      experience I have. Currently I am studying for my second degree (BBA) and working two jobs, as a project worker in Learning
      Analytics and as an executive area supervisor.

      As an IT guy I have several computers; 1 is running dual boot W7/W10, 2 W7 and 1 Ubuntu Budgie. As I live in a remote location I also
      have three UPS power supplies (~7kVA) backed by a diesel powered aggregator in case of blackouts.
